# Recognize Dogs and Cats

This web service has a piece of software (Convultional Neural Network) to recognize photos of dogs and cats and tells you whether the photo shows a dog or a cat.
Your uploaded photos will be deleted immediately after the automatic recognition is done and never saved in the server.

The photos used to train the neural network are acquired from a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition).

Now the recognition accuracy has reached around 94% with VGG16 + fine tuning, which is fairly good, although there is still room for improvement.
